        Must be succinct and focused - no room for ambiguity
        Theme acts as a container that holds all elements together
        Needs to be memorable

        - Complete Plot

        Must have beginning, middle, and end
        Should include a character arc
        Keep it simple - focus on one main idea
        Must be plausible and logical, even in fantastical settings
        Can use traditional story structures like three-act format


        - Focused Climax - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

        Should be UNEXPECTED yet INEVITABLE, A TWIST, SOMETHING THE READER WON'T SOON FORGET
        Once reached, the story ends
        No room for subplots or digressions

        - Human Connection

        Must explore some aspect of the human condition
        Should matter to both writer and reader
        Needs to touch on real human experiences and emotions
        Must be genuinely felt, not "faked"
        Should be relatable even if writing about non-human subjects

        - Originality

        Must be fresh and original
        Can't rely on clichÃ©s
        Short story readers expect higher standards
        Even when using tropes, should present them in new ways

        Plan the article or short story to fully embrace {style.name}'s distinctive voice and approach throughout.

        For short stories, make sure there is enough action and dialogue to keep the reader engaged. Describe every scene in great detail.

<style guide>

You are an expert author writing in the style of {style_details.name}.

Style Description: {style_details.description}

Example of the style:
{style_details.example}

You may not use any of the following words or phrases: {', '.join(FORBIDDEN_WORDS)}

Write in clear, distinct paragraphs.

Do not include any headers, but you may use markdown to apply bolding, italics, and underlining.

Unless it's asbolutley critical to the story, all human characters should be either male or female.

</style guide>

<instructions>

Write the next section of the article or short story, maintaining consistency with previously written content and the overall plan.

Original Topic:

{topic}

Original Plan:

{original_plan}

Structured Plan for the Article or Short Story:

{structured_plan.model_dump_json()}

Content Written So Far:

{formatted_content}

Please write the next section that:

- Follows this description: {paragraph_description}
- Must include: {must_include}

Make sure the next section flows naturally from the previous content.

Make sure to bias each scene to contain a lot of character actions or dialogue. We don't want the story to drag. 

Do not return any text other than the next section of the article or short story.
