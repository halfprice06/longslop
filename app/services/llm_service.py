        Every element of the story must tie back to the central theme
        Must be succinct and focused - no room for ambiguity
        Theme acts as a container that holds all elements together
        Needs to be memorable

        - Complete Plot

        Must have beginning, middle, and end
        Should include a character arc
        Keep it simple - focus on one main idea
        Must be plausible and logical, even in fantastical settings
        Can use traditional story structures like three-act format


        - Focused Climax - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

        Everything must lead to the climax
        Every word and element should work toward this destination
        Should be UNEXPECTED yet INEVITABLE, A TWIST, SOMETHING THE READER WON'T SOON FORGET
        Once reached, the story ends
        No room for subplots or digressions

        - Human Connection

        Must explore some aspect of the human condition
        Should matter to both writer and reader
        Needs to touch on real human experiences and emotions
        Must be genuinely felt, not "faked"
        Should be relatable even if writing about non-human subjects

        - Originality

        Must be fresh and original
        Can't rely on clichÃ©s
        Short story readers expect higher standards
        Even when using tropes, should present them in new ways

        Plan the short story to fully embrace {style.name}'s distinctive voice and approach throughout.

        Make sure there is enough action and dialogue to keep the reader engaged. Describe every scene in great detail.

        Make sure in every scene you have completely anazlyed the characters and their motivations and specifically plan why they are taking specific actions. Think long term about the whole story when planning.

        Make sure to bias each scene to contain a lot of character actions or dialogue. We don't want the story to drag.

    </end scene>

    Each paragraph in the input text should be its own paragraph in the json output. 

    It's going to feel awkward to write in the JSON format, but you have to extract the content exactly as written just as JSON. For example, if the input content were "Net's caught again," Danny said. His neck was tight and the tendons showed.", you must write it like:

    {{"speaker": "Danny", "text": "Net's caught again,"}}
    {{"speaker": "Narrator", "text": "Danny said. His neck was tight and the tendons showed."}}

    In other words, you have to capture when the narrator explains who's speaking. Make sure to end regular speaking sentences with a comma so the Narrator can finish the sentence, unless the speaker is asking a question or exclaiming.We are going to concatenate these conversation turns together later, but they won't have the speaker labels, so we need the Narrator's portion to capture who's speaking.

Original Topic:

{topic}

Original Plan:

{original_plan}

Structured Plan for the Article or Short Story:

{structured_plan.model_dump_json()}

Content Written So Far:

{formatted_content}

Please write the next section that:

- Follows this description: {scene_description}
- Must include: {must_include}

Put all of your effort into making sure that this section naturally flows from the previous section and ensure that the beginning of each section has an introduction that connects to the previous section or sets up the scene change.

Make sure to bias each scene to contain a lot of character actions or dialogue. We don't want the story to drag. 

Do not return any text other than the next section of the article or short story.
